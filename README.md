**⚠️ Warning**: MyBibliotheca is under heavy development. Always back up your data before upgrading. The developers do not guarantee data persistence or error-free operation. Please submit issues to the repository, and we will address them as soon as possible.

**MyBibliotheca** is a self-hosted personal library and reading-tracker—your open-source alternative to Goodreads, StoryGraph, and Fable! It lets you log, organize, and visualize your reading journey. Add books by ISBN, track reading progress, log daily reading, and generate monthly wrap-up images of your finished titles.

🆕 **Multi-User Features**: Multi-user authentication, user data isolation, admin management, and secure password handling.

## 🛠️ Enhancements in This Fork

This fork builds on the last upstream release with the following additions:

### New Features
- 🤝 **Book Loans**: Track books you've loaned out from **More → Loans** — record a borrower's name, phone number, and loan date, then mark returned when the book comes back. A "Loaned Out" filter on the library page shows everything currently out.
- 🏷️ **Curated Genre Filtering**: Genres pulled from Google Books/OpenLibrary are matched against an allowlist of ~150 common English genres, with foreign-language labels filtered out and near-duplicates normalized (e.g. *Sci-Fi* → *Science Fiction*), capped at 5 genres per book.
- 🥧 **Raspberry Pi / ARM Support**: Dedicated `Dockerfile.pi` and `docker-compose.pi.yml` using ARM-friendly wheels (piwheels, headless OpenCV) and a tuned KuzuDB `max_db_size` so the database no longer crashes on ARM's constrained virtual address space.
- ⚙️ **One-Command Setup**: `./setup.sh` generates a `.env` with fresh secrets, auto-detects ARM hardware to pick the right Docker Compose file, and optionally prompts for a personal Google Books API key.
- 🔑 **Personal Google Books API Key**: Set `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` to use your own quota instead of sharing a default key, avoiding HTTP 429 rate-limit errors during metadata lookups and imports.

### Reliability Fixes
- 🔄 **Stale Page Fixes**: The Library and Stats pages now correctly refresh after adding books, logging reading sessions, running bulk/CSV imports, or changing the background image in admin settings — previously these could keep showing cached (304'd) content well after the underlying data changed.
- 🪟 **Modals Fixed Sitewide**: Removed CSS stacking-context bugs that trapped Bootstrap modals behind their backdrop.
- 🖼️ **Custom Backgrounds & Cover Uploads**: Fixed the Aurora theme overriding configured background images, and fixed uploaded covers reverting to the default placeholder.
- 🔢 **ISBN Handling**: 9-digit ISBN-10s (as exported by Excel/Sheets, which strip leading zeros) are now padded and matched correctly during CSV import and metadata lookups.
- 📚 **Genre Counts**: Per-user genre counts on the library page no longer show library-wide totals.
